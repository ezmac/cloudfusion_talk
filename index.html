            ###### It doesn't start.
            - ColdFusion uses modified tomcat for Search Engine Safe URLS
            - SES breaks tomcat
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ###### Winning with Tomcat
            _You don't win with tomcat, you just lose a little less_
            - Coldfusion just Java and modified Tomcat
            - WARs use web.xml for mapping.  You can disable SES and other servlets here.
              - Less pointless app, less attack surface
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ###### Winning with Tomcat (continued)
            - CfClasspath != java classpath
            - CfClasspath adds ~50MB to WAR
            - Server config stored in WAR; swappable at WAR build
            - WAR will contain decryptable secrets and the decryption key
            - If the negatives are acceptable, you can run Coldfusion on stock tomcat
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            - EB's tomcat runs apache 2.2.32 as a proxy. In theory, you could use EB extensions to add CUWA.  I have not investigated this but I definitely will.
            - I also tried Ansible, but personal preference made me go back to Docker
            - If you can run without CUWA (maybe shibboleth) or complex infrastructure, look at AWS managed tomcat on Elastic Beanstalk.

          </aside>
          <section data-markdown>
            ##### CloudFusion

            - We never succeeded using git to deploy on CIT servers
            - Perfect is the enemy of good
              - duplicate what we have and improve it
            - Build a system that can run our software, even if not ideal
              - gain insight so we can move forward
              - fail loudly so there are no silent errors
            - Target: CF10 update 23, JVM 8, Apache 2.4 and CUWA.
            - Automate and monitor

            ###### Elastic Beanstalk

            - Mounts NFS for media volume (required by our software)
            - Sets environment for docker container(s)
            - Automatically provides AWS Credentials to container.
            - Volumes for docker containers(s)
            - Mockable on dev machines

            - Alerting

          <section data-markdown>
            ###### Gitlab
            - Gitlab is central to the process
            - Container CI pushes to DTR
            - Elastic Beanstalk deploys pull from DTR
            - Pushes to Application repositories deploy to EB
            - Process could be better, but we're not in prod yet.

            Oh you were serious.

          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ###### Testing

            - Automating processes without automating testing is insanity
            - Fortunately our apps fail with an appropriate status
            - Test recorder + site scraper + phantomjs = poor mans test suite

          <section data-markdown>
            ##### Still left to do
            - Logging
              - We're working with CIT to get a splunk instance in AWS
            - Databases
              - There's a noticable lag connecting to on-premise databases from AWS
                - Plus, you pay for it
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ##### Still left to do (continued)
            - Upgrade coldfusion
            - If we actually have working tests, we can more quickly test new versions of coldfusion, or even Lucee/Railo
            - Production SSL Certs
